## :blush: **Why?**

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty metric created by Fred Heichheld in 2003 through the publication of an article called The One Number You Need to Grow in Harvard University magazine, with the aim of measuring the degree of loyalty customers of companies in any segment, reflecting the experience and satisfaction of customers. The key performance indicator (KPI) is widely used due to its simplicity, reliability and flexibility. The NPS revolutionized customer satisfaction survey models, replacing the more obsolete survey methods, which for the most part make after-sales surveys long, tiring and boring for the customer. NPS ¬©, Net Promoter ¬© and Net Promoter ¬© Score are registered trademarks of Satmetrix Systems Inc., Bain & Company and Fred Heichheld.
